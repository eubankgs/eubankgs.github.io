I'm going off the dev tools because you didn't put your soure code on github, so thats some points off.
It's also hard to see the css so yeah.

First, when shrinking the window the text gets way too small to read, I suggest increasing the font size when that happens.

I would also suggest changing styles before the 'Game History' button becomes too small and adds a new line.

I also noticed you used `<br>` which is bad practice and you should instead just use seperate `<p>` elements

You could also put the section headers and the content cards within a grouped `<section>` element instead of them being seperate.
(on the empachion and uldisdunya pages)

finally, on the richard page I would say to try to resize richard so that the window doesn't add scroll bars while he's spinning
(if he is centered on the page, he should be sized such that the diagonal should be no larger than 100vh or 100vw. you could do this 
with the pythagorean theorem, where c is 100vw or 100vh whichever is smaller. if richard is a square that would just be 
`max-width = sqrt(100^2/2)vw; 
max-height = sqrt(100^2/2)vh;`)

I don't really know what else to say because I can't see the source code.
The website does look good (better than mine) but i can't tell how good the code is. (also if you need another dnd player at any point im down).
